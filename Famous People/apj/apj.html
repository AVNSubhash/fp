<h1><font size="10" color="blue">About Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam</h1></font>
<p><font size="6" color="green"><b>Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam (15 October 1931 – 27 July 2015) 
	was an Indian aerospace scientist who served as the 11th president of India from 2002 to 2007. He was born and
	 raised in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu and studied physics and aerospace engineering. He spent the next four decades
	  as a scientist and science administrator, mainly at the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) 
	  and Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and was intimately involved in India's civilian space programme
	   and military missile development efforts. He thus came to be known as the Missile Man of India for his 
	   work on the development of ballistic missile and launch vehicle technology. He also played a pivotal organisational, technical, and political role in India's Pokhran-II nuclear tests in 1998, the first 
	   since the original nuclear test by India in 1974.</p></font></b>
